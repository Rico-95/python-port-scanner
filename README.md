# ðŸ”Ž Python Port Scanner (Threaded)

A simple multithreaded TCP port scanner built in Python as part of a cybersecurity learning journey.

## Features

- Scans ports 20â€“1024 using TCP
- Uses multithreading for fast execution
- Reports open ports only
- For educational use (used `scanme.nmap.org`!)

## What I Learned

- Python's `socket` module
- TCP/IP and basic port scanning
- Python threading and concurrency
- Real-world CLI tool structure

## How to Run

```bash
python3 port_scanner.py
